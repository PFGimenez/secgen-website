Adrien Schoen will work at CISPA in Saarbrücken from October 16th to December 15th in collaboration with Joscha Cüppers and Jilles Vreeken. Following the work started with Joscha Cüppers during his stay at Inria, Adrien will work on generating sequences of flow descriptions from a set of patterns obtained by data mining. His second scientific challenge is the evaluation of temporal generated data.
