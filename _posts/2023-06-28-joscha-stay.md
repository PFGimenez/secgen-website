Joscha Cüppers will work at Inria in Rennes from July 18th to September 1st in collaboration with Adrien Schoen, Pierre-François Gimenez, and Frédéric Majorczyk. Their work will focus on adapting data mining methods based on MDL learning to extract patterns from sequences of flow descriptions. Network flow description sequences offer unique challenges and opportunities requiring significant changes to state-of-the-art methods.
